#Project 2 Main Page.

=== Introduction ===

The project 2 of OS lecture in UNI-SAARLAND SS09.

=== News ===

*28-05-2009*
Argument passing basically passed. Its correctness can be proofed by give echo different amount of parameters when running through command line. The output will be different when using 4 arguments and other amount of arguments.

*29-05-2009*
The structure of stack for system call is like below:

HIGH.          
arg2.
arg1.
arg0.
number(f->esp).
LOW.

getting value of parameter i (i ~ 0,2) when this parameter slot is unused, you will get random value.

*01-06-2009*
Implementing file operation functions. Considering the wait function.


=== Working Status ===

*26-05-2009* Half coding finished about passing argument and system call handler.

*28-05-2009* Argument passing basically passed. But can not make hex_dump() work normally.

*29-05-2009* Refined system call dispatcher and explored the stack structure for system call calling.

=== Details ===

Problem list:

*1* What is unmapped VM? How to determine whether a pointer is pointing to unmapped VM?

*2* Should we determine whether an argument's type is int or pointer just through the call number? is there any better way to determine the argument's type?

*3* How can make hex_dump() work? It so far prints out same content no matter push anything into stack.

*4* The process has to maintain a list of file descriptors, do it mean the corresponding thread should contains a list of FD?

*5* Is there a easy way to associate the file structure and FD together and enable to finding a file structure by FD?
