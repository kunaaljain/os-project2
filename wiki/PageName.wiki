#Project 2 Main Page.

=== Introduction ===

The project 2 of OS lecture in UNI-SAARLAND SS09.

=== News ===

*28-05-2009*
Argument passing basically passed. Its correctness can be proofed by give echo different amount of parameters when running through command line. The output will be different when using 4 arguments and other amount of arguments.

*29-05-2009*
The structure of stack for system call is like below:

HIGH    |---------------|              
        |    arg2       |
        |    arg1       |       
        |    arg0       |
        |    number     |   <- f->esp     
        |               |
LOW     |---------------|

=== Working Status ===

*26-05-2009* Half coding finished about passing argument and system call handler.

*28-05-2009* Argument passing basically passed. But can not make hex_dump() work normally.

*29-05-2009* Refined system call dispatcher and explored the stack structure for system call calling.

=== Details ===

Problem list:

*1* What is unmapped VM? How to determine whether a pointer is pointing to unmapped VM?

*2* Should we determine whether an argument's type is int or pointer just through the call number? is there any better way to determine the argument's type?

*3* How can make hex_dump() work? It so far prints out same content no matter push anything into stack.
