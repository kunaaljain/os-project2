#Project 2 Main Page.

= Introduction =

The project 2 of OS lecture in UNI-SAARLAND.

= Working Status =

*1* Half coding finished about passing argument and system call handler.

= Details =

Problem list:

*1* how to manipulate stack? Is there any function or easy way to do this job?
    The intr_frame->esp is the stack pointer, isn't it?
*2* in system call handler function
    how can I get information about which system call the user program is calling?
    In syscall0(number) (it indicates the number is 0), how the number can be SYS_HALT, SYS_EXIT?
*3* the lib/user/syscall.c has implemented the system call, but it seems not enough, should I modify the implementation and refine them?
